# üè• England Health Index (2020‚Äì2021): Service Access, Living Conditions & Life Expectancy

This project explores the **Health Index for England (2020/2021)**‚Äîfocusing on **Service Access**, **Living Conditions**, and **Life Expectancy** indicators. Using official data from the UK Government's open data repositories, built a full analytics pipeline to uncover regional inequalities and inform health planning decisions.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze spatial and temporal patterns in England‚Äôs **health service access**, infrastructure, and population health outcomes
- Identify areas with poor access to services and lower life expectancy
- Build a seamless data pipeline from **R to SQL**, with visuals powered by **Looker Studio**
- Empower public health professionals and policymakers with a clear, data-driven view of health equity across England

---

## üóÇ Data Sources

- üì• **[Health Index for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/health-index-for-england-2020-to-2021)** (ONS)
- üì• UK Open Government repositories (`data.gov.uk`)
- Indicators include:
  - Service Access (e.g. GP access, emergency care, transport links)
  - Living Conditions (e.g. housing, crime, pollution)
  - Life Expectancy (regional estimates, trends)

---

## üîÅ Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Used `readr`, `dplyr`, and `janitor` in **R** for importing and standardizing datasets
- Filtered data by indicator groups and normalized regional names and scores

### 2. **Database Integration**
- Connected R to **BigQuery** using `DBI` and `bigrquery`
- Created structured tables to support multi-dimensional querying by indicator, region, and year

### 3. **Data Exploration & Analysis**
- Performed descriptive and comparative analyses across England‚Äôs regions
- Highlighted correlations between service access and life expectancy

### 4. **Dashboard & Visual Analytics**
- Built dynamic visuals in **Looker Studio**
- Enabled filterable views by region, index group, and time
- Included choropleth maps, ranking bars, and year-over-year index trendlines
